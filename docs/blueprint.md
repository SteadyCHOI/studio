- Accent: Light sage (#B3C6A0) used sparingly for interactive elements and highlights to guide user attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its modern and neutral appearance. Use for both body text and headlines.
- Use simple, outlined icons with the light sage accent color (#B3C6A0) to represent game modes and features.
- Employ a clean, minimalist layout with ample spacing and clear visual hierarchy to emphasize readability and draw focus to the email subscription form.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in animations on page load and micro-interactions on button hover to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
